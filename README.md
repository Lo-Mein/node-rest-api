# Node.js REST API

Welcome to my Node.js REST API project! This project serves as a demonstration of my backend development skills using Node.js, Express, TypeScript, and MongoDB.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript on the server.
- **Express**: A fast, minimalist web framework for Node.js that simplifies building robust APIs.
- **TypeScript**: A statically typed superset of JavaScript that enhances code quality and maintainability.
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database used for data storage and retrieval.
- **Mongoose**: An ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js, making it easier to work with MongoDB.

## Features

### Environment, TypeScript, Nodemon Setup

I've configured the project with TypeScript and Nodemon for automatic server restarts during development. This ensures a smooth development experience.

### MongoDB & Mongoose Connect, Database Creation

The API connects to a MongoDB database using Mongoose. I've included database creation scripts and configurations to set up the database.

### Controllers Creation

I've implemented controllers to handle various API routes, ensuring clean and organized code for request handling.

### Middlewares Creation

Middleware functions are crucial for request processing. I've included middlewares for tasks like authentication, error handling, and input validation.

### Cookie-Based Authentication

This API supports cookie-based authentication to secure routes. Users can authenticate and access protected resources.

### Postman Testing

To demonstrate the functionality of the API, I've included a Postman collection that you can import and use for testing various endpoints.

### CRUD Operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)

The API supports CRUD operations for managing resources, such as creating, reading, and updating data.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Set up a MongoDB instance and configure the connection in `config/database.ts`.
4. Run the development server using `npm run dev`.
5. Explore the API using the provided Postman collection for testing.
